APIcast is an API gateway to be used together with Red Hat 3scale. This Operator supports standalone deployment of the gateway as opposed to the built-in APIcast as part of a 3scale installation.

### Supported Features
* **Installer** A way to install an APIcast gateway instance on Kubernetes
* **Upgrade** Upgrade from previously installed APIcast gateway instance
* **Reconcilliation** Tunable CRD parameters after the APIcast gateway is installed

### Upgrading your installation
